# OOAD_final_project

To open the game on windows, we have provided the "FPS Survival Game.exe" file. If you are not on windows see the instructions below for building our game.

The scripts which are documented in our UML diagram are located in /OOAD_whole_final_project/Assets/Scripts. Each file has a .meta version which unity creates. To view the code click the version that ends in .cs

##Build Instructions

1. Install the most recent version of Unity Hub: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
2. Clone our repository to wherever is convinient on your local machine.
3. To import our project into unity: on the Unity Hub select 'Add'. Navigate to where our repository is saved and select the folder: OOAD_whole_final_project. This will import the project.
4. At this point, you may be able to open the project. If you are missing the correct Unity Version however, you will need to add it. In the hub go to "Installs" and click "Add" -> "download archive". Select the correct version of Unity from the archive by clicking the "Unity Hub" option (importing our project will tell you which version to use if you don't already have it).
5. Once you have installed the correct unity version you can open our project.
6. Once open, select "Build and run". This will create a Unity app within the repository which can be run to play our game.

Note: When you run the game make sure to select a graphics quality of no higher than medium and make sure to stay away from lower resolutions as unity has poor UI element anchoring support when lower resolutions are used.
