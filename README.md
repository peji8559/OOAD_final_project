# OOAD_final_project

To open the game click the "FPS Survival Game.exe"

The scripts which are documented in our UML diagram are located in /OOAD_whole_final_project/Assets/Scripts. Each file has a .meta version which unity creates. To view the code click the version that ends in .cs

Note: When you run the game make sure to select a graphics quality of no higher than medium and make sure to stay away from lower resolutions as unity has poor UI element anchoring support when lower resolutions are used.
